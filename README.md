# hf0
## Hybrid f0 estimation using Convolutional Neural Network

hf0 is a monophonic pitch tracker based on a deep convolutional neural network operating over the time-domain normalized autocorrelation function. $hf_0$ works reliabilty over monophonic speech, monophonic songs, emotional speech, para-linguistic speech and infant cry signals. $hf_0$ is robust to varied noises and comparable against the state-of-the-art methods. 

## Dependencies

This code requires was tested in `MATLAB 2018a` version. The [MIR Toolbox 1.7.2](https://www.jyu.fi/hytk/fi/laitokset/mutku/en/research/materials/mirtoolbox) is required for the execution of the program.

## Execution of hf0
Execute `demo.m` file by replacing `filename` variable with the respective audio file.
